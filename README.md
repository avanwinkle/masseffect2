# Mass Effect 2: the Pinball Game

*"I'm Commander Shepard, and this is my favorite pinball game on the Citadel."*

Recruit a squad from the most skilled soldiers, biotics, and technicians across dozens of worlds. Survive the journey through the Omega 4 Relay and lead a suicide mission to the enemy's front door. Sacrifice everything, stand your ground, and save the galaxy.

The **Mass Effect 2 Pinball Game** brings the challenge and excitement of BioWare's sci-fi epic to the arcade table so you can re-live the most exciting missions of Commander Shepard's quest as a brand-new pinball experience. From the slums of Omega to the towers of Illium and from the decks of the Normandy to the heart of the Collector base, the Mass Effect 2 Pinball Game is the ultimate challenge for Spectres of the steel ball.

## Requirements

This project requires the Mission Pinball Framework 0.50 and can be simulated using the MPF virtual machine and MPF monitor interface. Playing in the real world requires a Stern Game of Thrones Pro Edition pinball machine and the MPF-Spike-Bridge.

## Main Gameplay

**Spoiler Warning:**
*In recreating the full experience of Mass Effect 2, the Pinball Game includes significant characters and story events from the original game.*

### Recruitment Missions
The core challenge of the ME2 Pinball Game is to recruit a squad to take with you on the Suicide Mission. When the game starts all five of the major shots are lit with a possible squadmate—hit a shot three times to light that character's recruitment mission. After a mission is lit, a second one will appear on that same shot for a total of ten possible recruitment missions. Once lit, a recruitment mission can be started from the left ramp.

* **The Professor - Curing the Plague**

  Hit the spinner to build value and the right orbit to place the cure and add multipliers. Hit both fan shots to disburse the cure and complete the mission.

* **Archangel - Siege on Omega**

  Take out mercenaries for points and hit each of the three lit shots to close the shutters to stop the assault. Get upstairs and protect Archangel to complete the mission.

* **The Warlord - Defeating the Tank-Bred**

  Hit each lit shot to defeat a tank-bred Krogan. Finish all shots to complete the mission.

* **The Convict - Escaping Purgatory Prison**

  Hit any lit shot to build points and unlock a prison door, then hit the right hitbank to collect the value and advance through the prison. Advance three times to complete the mission.

* **The Thief - Breaking and Entering**

  Hit any un-lit shot to infiltrate the stronghold, but watch out! After every round another shot will be lit with an alarm, and hitting any alarm shot fails the mission! Advance four times to complete the mission.

* **The Assassin - Assaulting Dantius Towers**

  Advance up the ramps to build value and ascend the towers. Once high enough, hit one of the lit orbit shots to cross the bridge and complete the mission.

* **The Quarian - Geth on Haestrom**

  Hit the lit shot to weaken the Geth Colossus, hit either bank to take cover and add time. Hit the Colossus six times to defeat it and complete the mission, but if the timer runs out the Colossus will self-repair and the mission must be restarted.

* **Legion - Hacking the Heretics**

  Hit the lit shots to move through the Geth base and build value, then hit the kickback lane to begin the hack. Additional shots will build value until the hack is complete, then hit the left bank (to reprogram) or the right bank (to destroy) and complete the mission.

* **The Mercenary - Blue Suns Refinery**

  Choose the blue shot to rescue the factory workers (with higher hurry-up times), or the red shot to pursue Vido (with higher multipliers), and hit additional shots to build value. Shoot a full orbit to complete the mission.

* **The Justicar - Chasing Morinth**

  Hit the standup targets to collect intel and light shots, hit the lit shots to collect value and pursue Morinth. Hit five shots to complete the mission.

### Collector Missions
At various points in the game, special missions will become available which present Commander Shepard with opportunities to face the Collectors head-on. Some of these missions are unlocked based on the number of squadmates recruited, others are unlocked based on the player's level.

* The Collector Ship

  Survive waves of ambushing Collectors and hordes of Husks before facing off with the Praetorian in this high-intensity multiball.

* The Derelict Reaper

  Speed is the name of the game in this high-stakes multiball as Commander Shepard must fight through waves of husks and scions to find the IFF and get out before the Reaper falls.

* The Collector Attack

  Follow the emergency lighting and avoid Collector forces as you make your way towards an escape in this dark survival mission.

### The Suicide Mission
Advance far enough in ME2 Pinball to unlock the Suicide Mission, a multi-part wizard mode that pits you and your squad against the toughest challenges ever faced.

* Passing the Omega 4 Relay

  Bring your ship upgrades and make your stand against oculus sentries and the behemoth Collector ship in this chaotic timed multiball.

* Infiltrating the Collector Base

  Choose a specialist to enter the vent and follow the lit shots to activate the valves and get them through safely, fighting Collectors all the while in this two-ball battle. Don't let the timer run out!

* The Long Walk

  Choose a biotic specialist to protect the squad and follow the blue shots to make your way deeper into the base. Don't let your squadmates get too far behind!

* The Reaper

  Finish the fight in this two-phase mode, alternating between taking down Collectors during a four-ball multiball and playing cat-and-mouse against a Reaper. Build up attack damage and hit the Reaper repeatedly to take it down, but watch out for its deadly beam cannon!

* Escape

  Get your surviving squadmates to safety and build up value during this high-speed multiball, then hit the final shot to destroy the base and complete the Suicide Mission.

## Additional Gameplay

### Lair of the Shadow Broker
Drop the bank of targets to gather intel on the Shadow Broker and start this mini-wizard mode. Complete three banks to unlock the Vasir car chase, then follow the shots and defeat Vasir in combat to get the data disk. Complete additional drop banks to unlock Hagalaz and Storm the Shadow Broker's ship, defeating his mercenaries to meet him face-to-face in a two-ball battle.

### Overlord
Hit the Geth target banks to clear a station on Aite and hit the left ramp to lock a ball and disable the lockdown. When all three stations are complete the Overlord three-ball multiball begins—hit the glowing shots to build value, and watch out for the blinking lights of data upload shots. When they appear, no more value can be built until the uploads are destroyed.

*This mission is only available prior to the Collector Ship mission*

### Arrival
Hit the Batarian target banks to celar a path through Project Base and hit the left ramp to lock a ball and get the station online. When all three systems are restored the Arrival three-ball multiball begins—hit the lit shots to build value and the pulsing shot for multipliers as the station heads towards Alpha. Watch out for the timer and make sure to hit the escape shot before time runs out!

*This mission is only available after the Collector Ship mission*
