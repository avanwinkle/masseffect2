# ME2 Core Configuration

The core configuration is divided into multiple files, for ease of use, and may be subdivided more in the future.

* **[config.yaml]** handles the MPF configuration (modes, player variables, mpf-mc)
* **[hardware.yaml]** handles the Spike Game of Thrones hardware (switches, coils, lights, devices)
* **[keyboard.yaml]** handles key bindings for convenience during testing.
