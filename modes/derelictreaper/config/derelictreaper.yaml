#####
# DERELICT REAPER
#
# This is a multiball mode on a timer. Each lane is lit to damage the Reaper's
# core, each target is lit (as a husk) to increase the timer. Completing the
# lanes lights a super jackpot shot on a timer, after which the lanes reset.
# If the husk timer runs out, a special shot must be hit to re-enable the lanes.
#
# This mode is like a recruitment mission in that it can be chosen from mission
# select and can be replayed until completed--and this mission must be completed
# in order to enable the IFF counter and progress to the Suicide Mission.
#
# This mode has some complex rules for ending the mode and completing the
# "derelictreaper" achievement:
# Once all five shots have been completed, hitting the super jackpot or draining
# all balls will complete the achievement. If the jackpot is hit and multiple
# balls are still active, the shots will reset and play will continue until
# only one ball remains. If the jackpot is hit and only one ball is active, the
# mode ends immediately.
#
# Shot progress on the reaper core lanes is saved.
