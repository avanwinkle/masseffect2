#####
# DERELICT REAPER
#
# This is a multiball mode on a timer, with alternating phases. The first phase
# is a frenzy mode that accumulates towards a hit threshold to start the second
# phase. The second phase is a timeout opportunity to strike the captive ball and
# damage the reaper core.

# It takes 3 hits to the reaper core to complete the mode. A maximum of two hits
# can be struck on the first attempt. After the timeout ends, play returns to
# the first phase and the multiball resumes.
#
# If there is no ball in the airlock when the second phase starts, loading one
# into the lock will count as the first hit.
#
# This mode is like a recruitment mission in that it can be chosen from mission
# select and can be replayed until completed--and this mission must be completed
# in order to enable the IFF counter and progress to the Suicide Mission.
#
# This mode has some complex rules for ending the mode and completing the
# "derelictreaper" achievement:
# Once all five shots have been completed, hitting the super jackpot or draining
# all balls will complete the achievement. If the jackpot is hit and multiple
# balls are still active, the shots will reset and play will continue until
# only one ball remains. If the jackpot is hit and only one ball is active, the
# mode ends immediately.
#
# Shot progress on the reaper core lanes is saved.
