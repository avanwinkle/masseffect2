#####
# FIREWALKER MODE
#
# This mode is the base for the Firewalker missions. All the missions
# share the same shots with shows and very similar behavior. This base
# mode defines those shots, and uses custom code for the exact gameplay
# rules based on the player's progress.
#
# Each mode lights shots at red, and uses the red -> orange -> green progression
# to collect research packets and complete the mode. As the modes advance,
# the rules change to increase difficulty. Hitting any green shot will complete
# the mode (except for the final multiball).
#
# ROSALIE:          All shots are lit. Hitting any shot advances all shots.
# VOLCANO STATION:  All shots are lit. Hitting any shot disables _that_ shot
#                   and advances the rest.
# GETH INCURSION:   All shots are lit. Hitting any shot advances _that_ shot.
# SURVEY SITES:     All shots are lit. Hitting any shot advances _that_ shot
#                   and resets all the rest.
# PROTHEAN SITE:    A special multiball! Gets its own mode.
