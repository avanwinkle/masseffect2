#####
# MASS EFFECT 2: GLOBAL MODE
#
# This is the general mode that underlies non-Wizard-mode gameplay, and handles
# progression tracking for global values like N7 missions, shadowbroker drops,
# and multiball lights.
#
# This mode does NOT include lights, sounds, and shows for these progressions,
# since active mission modes may overrule them. Instead, those elements are part
# of the Field mode.
