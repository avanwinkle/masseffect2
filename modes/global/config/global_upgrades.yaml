#####
# UPGRADES MODE
#
# ** WEAPON UPGRADES **
# These upgrades are acquired via a bonus shot every time a
# recruitment mission is completed. Hitting the shot awards
# big points and collects a weapon upgrade, which increases
# the points earned for all missions (given as a ball-end bonus).
#
# ** SHIP UPGRADES **
# These mission-critical upgrades are aquired from the bonus
# shot and are enabled after every 3 levels. They take priority
# over weapon upgrades, but will be lost if another levelup
# awards a new weapon upgrade. If one is missed, the player
# can reclaim it after the others. These upgrades provide
# major bonuses during the Suicide Mission:
#   - Silaris Armor increases ball save time
#   - Thanix Cannon increases points collected and Reaper damage
#   - Multicore shielding increases timers
