#####
# HARBINGER MODE
#
# This mode layers atop other game modes, specifically story missions featuring
# the Collectors (i.e. Collector Ship and Suicide Mission).
#
# FAST:
# Once enabled (after a brief delay) a lock lights on the airlock lane to
# capture a ball. Once captured, a timed captive ball shot is enabled that
# increases the playfield multiplier. When the timer runs out, the captive ball
# is released back to the playfield and (after another delay), the lock lights
# again.
#
# SPIKE:
# Once enabled, this mode alternates a timed shot (available for 15s, disabled
# for 15s) at the battering ram. Hitting the ram twice during the 15s window
# increases the playfield multiplier 1x for 60 seconds. These multipliers can
# stack, but all are reset when the mode ends.
#
# Raising the multiplier disables the shot immediately, otherwise the shot is
# disabled after the timer runs out. Regardless, the shot will re-enable after
# 15s.
