#####
# LOCKHANDLER MODE
#
# This is a game logic mode to handle the complex logic of balls entering the
# ball device (bd_lock) via the left ramp.
#
# Most of the logic is handled in a custom Python class (lockhandler.py). This
# yaml file instantiates that class, sets up an event listener to trigger the
# class handler.

# Also this yaml file has got some multiball_lock logic because the class
# interacts with multiball devices directly and it kinda makes it easier to have
# all that contained here. Once the logic/behavior is stable, it may make more
# sense to move the multiball locks to their respective modes.
