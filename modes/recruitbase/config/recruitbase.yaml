# RECRUIT BASE MODE
#
# This game logic mode underlies the various recruitment collection and mission
# modes. It is primarily responsible for handling the transition in and out of
# recruitment missions and holding logic that is shared among them (events,
# slides, timers, and scoring).
#
# One particularly important role of Recruit Base is handling other modes so
# that every recruitment mission doesn't have to worry about enabling/disabling.
# Persistent side-modes like N7 Assignments, Shadow Broker, and multiballs are
# called "nonrecruit modes" and it's up to Recruit Base to en/disable them when
# recruitment missions start. Much easier than copying the same code between
# all the different recruitment missions!
#
# Recruit Base is mostly event-driven and idempotent, so it may never need to be
# stopped (although stopping it would free up a lot of event listeners). Right
# now it's a standalone mode to keep the logic in digestable chunks.
