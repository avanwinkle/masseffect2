#####
# GRUNT RECRUITMENT MISSION
#
# All shots are lit on this mode with a brief timer; hitting a shot un-lights it
# and adds to the timer. Values are collected immediately based on the timer
# amount remaining with a multiple of the number of consecutive shots hit (i.e.
# restarting the mode reduces maximum value). The mode is completed when all
# shots have been hit, and ends if the timer expires.
#
# Progress is saved after every shot hit.

# GRUNT SCORING:
#    Hurryup starts at 8,000
#    Hit any lit shot to collect the hurryup
#    New hurryup is 8,000 plus 50% bonus for each hit shot *since mode start*
#    Hurryup depletion is fixed (always 390 points-per-second)
#    Hit all 5 shots to complete the mission
#    Progress is saved after each shot (but the bonus multiplier resets)
