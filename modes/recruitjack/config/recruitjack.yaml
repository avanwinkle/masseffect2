# JACK RECRUITMENT MISSION
#
# This round-based mode begins with three ramp/orbit shots lit for hurry-up, and
# a timer. Hitting any of the shots stops the hurry-up value depletion (but
# doesnâ€™t stop the timer) and lights the hitbank; hitting the hitbank captures
# the hurry-up value and starts the next round. The second round and third
# rounds have only two hurry-up shots lit. Collecting all three rounds completes
# the mode; the mode ends if the timer expires.
#
# Progress is saved after each round (ramp/orbit shot + hitbank shot).
