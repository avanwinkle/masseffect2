#####
# THANE RECRUITMENT MISSION
#
# This mode begins with the ramps lit to enter the Dantius towers, and each
# subsequent hit to either ramp advances the player up a floor and builds value.
# After 3 floors (1 if restarted) the orbits are lit to capture the value and
# complete the mode, and the ramps remain available to continue building value.
# The mode will end if the timer expires.
#
# Progress is not saved and this mode must be restarted if failed.
