# THANE RECRUITMENT MISSION
#
# This mode begins with the ramps lit to enter the Dantius towers, and each
# subsequent hit to either ramp advances the player up a floor and builds value.
# After 3 floors (1 if restarted) the orbits are lit to capture the value and
# complete the mode, and the ramps remain available to continue building value.
# The mode will end if the timer expires.
#
# Progress is not saved and this mode must be restarted if failed.
#
# TODO: This mode has only been mocked out, not tested or debugged

# THANE SCORING:
#    Build value starts at 0
#    Hit either tower ascent shot to add (10,000 points * ascent_shots_hit)
#    Exponential growth! Maybe this should be mitigated or depleted over time?
#    After 3 ascent shots, hit either orbit to collect built value and complete
#      the mission (only 1 ascent shot required if mission was restarted)
#    Player can continue to try for ascent shots for maximum score buildup
#      before the timer runs out.. no maximum score for this mission?
#    Progress is not saved
