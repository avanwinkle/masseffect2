#####
# ZAEED RECRUITMENT MISSION
#
# This mode begins with both orbit shots lit, and the objective varies depending
# on which shot the player hits. Once an orbit is hit, either orbit can be hit
# repeatedly to build value; after 3 hits, the kickback lane is lit to collect
# the value and complete the mode. The mode ends if the timer runs out.
#
# If the player chooses the left orbit (paragon, lit blue), the timer starts
# higher and more time is added to the timer with each orbit hit. If the player
# chooses the right orbit (renegade, lit red), the timer starts lower and a
# bonus multiplier increases the captured value when the mode is completed.
#
# Progress is not saved and this mode must be restarted if failed.
#
# TODO: This mode has only been mocked out, not thoroughly tested

#    Hurryup depletes at a constant rate of 90/s
#    Each orbit hit builds the hurryup at that time
