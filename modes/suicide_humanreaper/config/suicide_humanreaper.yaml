#####
# SUICIDE MISSION Pt. V (Phase 2): THE HUMAN REAPER
#
# This mode is the second phase of the Suicide Mission penultimate mode, which
# has a countdown for the reaper's cannon and a random shot lit for the reaper.
#
# Hitting the reaper shot does X damage to the reaper, where x is the built value
# carried over from the Platforms phase times a multiplier for the round. A bigger
# multiple of the damage is counted for the player's score and the game returns
# to the platform phase to build another value.
#
# When the reaper's cannon is charged, it begins a firing sequence. During this
# sequence a shot to any ball hold/lock will hold the ball until after the firing.
# At the end of the sequence, lights flash and the flippers will be temporarily
# disabled.
#
# If all balls drain during the reaper battle, a squadmate can sacrifice themselves
# to save Shepard (a maximum of two per ball). If all squadmates have died, this
# is no longer an option.
#
# The reaper/platforms cycle will continue until
#  A) the reaper takes enough damage and its hp is zero, or
#  B) the reaper takes any damage after 5 rounds have been played
