# SUICIDE MISSION Pt. IV (Phase 1): PLATFORMS
#
# This mode is the first phase of the Suicide Mission penultimate mode, which runs
# a four-ball multiball with unlimited saves and all shots lit to build value.
# The value built is not awarded as points, but saved as a "damage" hurryup for
# the next phase.
#
# Hurryups start at 1,000 points and reset each time a shot is hit. The Reaper
# has 10,000 HP, so ~10 perfect hits to kill. Is that too many? Only playtesting
# will find out...
