# SUICIDE MISSION Pt IV: TUBES
#
# This mode lights the outer four shots as the support tubes for the reaper, and
# the player must hit all of them to light the center shot to set the bomb and
# complete the mode.
#
# This features a 2-ball multiball with an add/save every time a tube is hit.
#
# Progress is saved for this mode.
